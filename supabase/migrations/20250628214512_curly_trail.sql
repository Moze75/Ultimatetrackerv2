  # Fix character deletion issues
  
  1. Changes
    - Ensure proper CASCADE deletion for related data
    - Fix RLS policies for DELETE operations
    - Add function to safely delete characters with all related data
    - Ensure proper permissions for character deletion
  
  2. Security
    - Users can only delete their own characters
    - All related data is properly cleaned up
    - Maintains data integrity
